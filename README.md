# Expense Tracker Backend

Welcome to the backend of the Expense Tracker Full-Stack Project! This robust RESTful API is built with Spring Boot and PostgreSQL, designed meticulously for tracking expenses, scanning receipts, and managing financial records. ðŸ’¸

## What is This?
This backend handles all the heavy lifting for the Expense Tracker. It's built to endure the demands of precise bookkeepers and budget-savvy users alike.

### Tech Stack:
- **Java 17**: Modern Java, because we're fancy like that.
- **Spring Boot 3**: For robust back-end services.
- **Spring Data JPA & Spring Validation**: Because data matters and so does its integrity.
- **H2 Database**: For testing without tears.
- **PostgreSQL**: For production because we're serious about data.
- **Swagger UI**: For easy testing and beautiful documentation.
- **JUnit 5 & Mockito**: For making sure everything actually works.

### Features:
- **Full CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete â€” all your expenses are under your control.
- **Database Persistence**: From H2 in dev to PostgreSQL in production.
- **Swagger UI**: Auto-generated docs that make testing a breeze.
- **Exception Handling**: We handle errors gracefully, keeping the backend stable.

### Api Endpoints:
- GET /api/expenses: Fetch all the money you've ever spent.
- GET /api/expenses/{id}: Get an expense by ID.
- POST /api/expenses: Confess a new expense.
- PUT /api/expenses/{id}: Update the details of an existing expense.
- DELETE /api/expenses/{id}: Forget an expense ever happened.

### Testing Coverage:
- Service Layer Testing: We mock the repositories to test service logic.
- Controller Testing: We use MockMVC to ensure our endpoints are top-notch.
- Integration Testing: Full API behavior validation â€” nothing gets past us.

### Setup Database:
- Default: H2 
- For Production: Switch to PostgreSQL.
